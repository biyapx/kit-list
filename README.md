   cd kit-list```
3. **Navigate to the src/data/kits directory** This is where the list of kits is stored.
```
cd src/data/kits
```
4. **Create a new .ts file for your kit** Name the file according to the kit's name, using lowercase and (e.g. myawesomekit.ts).

5. **Structure your file similarly to the existing ones in the kits directory** Hereâ€™s an example format:
```
import animata from "@/assets/images/animata.png";
import svgl from "@/assets/images/svgl.png";
export const uiuxKit = [
    {
        title: 'Animata',
        image : animata,
        tags: ["UI/UX"],
        url: 'https://animata.design',
        author: {
            name: "Biya",
            url: "https://biyacraft.vercel.app",
            avatar: ayalkbetsIcon,
          },
    },
    {
        title: 'Svgl',
        image : svgl,
        tags: ["UI/UX"],
        url: 'https://svgl.app',
        author: {

          },
    },
]
```
6. ***Navigate to the src/data/index.ts file*** This is where import the data you added. The code should look something like this:

  ...uiuxKit,
  ...portfolioKit,

  ...yourkitname,
];
```
